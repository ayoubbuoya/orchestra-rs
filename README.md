A Rust crate that you'll use to build your AI agent workflow or your AI application. Orchestra-rs provides a powerful framework for orchestrating production-ready applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Vision

The goal of **Orchestra-rs** is to be the `LangChain` of the Rust ecosystem. We aim to provide a composable, safe, and efficient set of tools to chain together calls to LLMs, APIs, and other data sources. By leveraging Rust's powerful type system and performance, Orchestra-rs empowers developers to build reliable and scalable AI applications and intelligent agents with confidence.

## Project Status

**ðŸŒ± Early Development Stage**

Orchestra-rs is in the very early stages of development. The core APIs are currently being designed and are subject to change. This is the perfect time to get involved, contribute ideas, and help shape the future of the framework.

## Getting Started (Future)

Once the initial version is released, you will be able to add Orchestra-rs to your project like this:

```toml
# In your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
